# Goal
- Implement neural networks without high-level abstract libraries.
- Be the best explained low-level neural network on the web. 
- - It's as if people doing NN TRY to make it hard to understand, naming their variables in cryptic acronyms...

# 1Bullet
- Fix gradient descent (accuracy not improving)
